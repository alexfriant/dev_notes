//Problem: It look gross in smaller browser widths and small devices
//Solution: To hide the text links and swap them out with a more appropriate navigation

//Create a select and append to menu
//Cycel over menu links
  //Create an option
  //Option's value is the href
  //Option's text is the text of link
  //Append option to select
//Create button
//Bind click to button
  //Go to select's location
//Modify CSS to hide links on small screen widths
  //Also hides select and button on larger screen widths
//Deal with selected option depending on current page
